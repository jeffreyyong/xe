The purpose of this technical challenge is for you to demonstrate your ability to structure an
api in a way that is testable, deployable and extensible. We hope that the challenge should
take you less than 2 hours. We do not recommend spending more time on it than that.
The Challenge
Please write a gola ng/PHP application that is “ready to be deployed”. The application should:
● Have an endpoint that calls https://exchangeratesapi.io/ to get the latest exchange
rates for the base currencies of GBP and USD.
● It should return the value of 1 GBP or 1 USD in euros.
● It should check that value against the historic rate for the last week and make a naive
recommendation as to whether this is a good time to exchange money or not.
What we are looking for:
● Well organised code.
● Easy to run/deploy.
● Clear instructions on how to get the application running.
